# vkwebedit

VKWebEdit is an experimental editor I wrote to create and retrieve patches for my Korg Volca Keys synth. It is implemented using the Web MIDI API according to the MIDI specification released by Korg.

A live version can be tested at my personal site: http://sanchezcrespillo.info/david/vkwebedit

Comments and suggestions are welcome!
